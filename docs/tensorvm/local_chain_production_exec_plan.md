# Local Chain Production Execution Plan

This file is the durable source of truth for local-chain production-readiness work. Keep it compact:
current status, active/recent iterations, validation evidence, blockers, and archive commit anchors only.

## Current State

- Active feature: Iteration 93 complete - invalid-output delayed reward voiding.
- Current status: delayed proposer, receipt, challenge, validator-audit, and credit rewards are
  state-rooted pending claims. Validator-owned proposal, block votes, audit-report gossip, observed
  malformed block-check challenge handling, parent-state snapshots, and delayed challenge rewards are
  implemented locally. Late invalid-output attestations now contest settled receipts by voiding delayed
  pending receipt rewards before maturity.
- Current blockers:
  - `docs/tensorvm/codex_5_5_local_chain_workflow.md` is referenced by `goal.md` but is missing.
  - `cargo tarpaulin --workspace --offline` is blocked because `cargo-tarpaulin` is not installed:
    `error: no such command: tarpaulin`.
  - Full Docker runtime verification remains unresolved from the prior recorded run: gateway `/health`
    timed out with `curl: (28) Operation timed out after 15002 milliseconds with 0 bytes received`.
- Next action: continue full multi-branch fork-tree work, remaining fraud-path/slashing work, or rerun the
  full Docker scenario after the `/health` blocker clears.

## Readiness Matrix

| Capability | Status | Evidence | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gate 0 local CPU testnet | Passing | First command this iteration: `cargo test -p tensor_vm local_testnet --release` passed on June 20, 2026 | Keep as first executable gate on every resume |
| Shared chain engine/profile-neutral API | Complete for current core | Shared `ChainEngine`, `ChainCommand`, profile tests, local-testnet Gate 0 | Preserve one transition engine while adding IR/runtime features |
| Role-owned miner receipts | Implemented locally | Miner role submits receipts through `ChainCommand::SubmitReceipt`; checker expects live counters | Rerun full Docker checker after `/health` blocker clears |
| Role-owned validator attestations | Implemented locally | Validator role verifies assigned receipts, fetches tensors remotely, submits attestations | Keep as input path for IR-backed jobs |
| Role-owned validator block votes | Implemented locally | Validator role submits/gossips `SubmitBlockVote`; non-producers ingest/apply votes | Preserve append/finality separation |
| Role-owned validator proposer tick | Implemented in Rust runtime; Docker proof pending | `validator_proposer_tick_runs_without_synthetic_producer_gate`; useful proposal counters; delayed proposer rewards; current-head useful competitor replacement | Rerun Docker and continue full fork-tree policy |
| Network-visible event ingestion | Implemented locally | Node runtime ingests decoded jobs, receipts, attestations, block payloads, votes, audits, and block-check challenges | Extend only through shared codecs/events |
| Canonical useful-verification block validity | Partial | UVPoW target/nonce, selected roots, checks roots, beacon binding, fallback eligibility/timeout, parent snapshots, delayed rewards, diagnostic block-check challenges, current-head competitor policy | Remaining: full transcript disputes, full multi-branch fork trees, fresh Docker proof |
| Tensor IR graph language | Partial | `TensorGraph`, canonical JSON, `graph_id`, registry validation, program storage/serving, graph jobs/receipts, exact replay for current core and broad Tier-B surface | Continue exact Tier-B verifier coverage and role-runtime arbitrary graph production |
| Per-op `F_p` conformance vectors | Partial | Registry guard, CPU profile evidence, vectors for current admitted ops; default CUDA non-admission | Add CUDA conformance evidence and remaining exact Tier-B vectors |
| Randomness commit/reveal or VRF beacon | Partial | Receipts persist receipt-time finalized beacon randomness, assignment seed, validation seed commitment; attestations require anchor; status/explorer expose seed-domain and block-hash-ban evidence | Add external drand/VRF construction and deployed commit-reveal lifecycle |
| Economics and slashing invariant | Partial | Delayed rewards, reward-root binding, mature release, late invalid-output reward voiding, audit/data-unavailability slashing, appeal reversal, pending claim view, study helper, validator-audit/fraud-path calibration, and structured detection-probability evidence | Add deployed-run detection measurements, remaining fraud paths, and broader invalid-output stake slashing |
| Public deployment evidence | Not complete | Public evidence validators/templates exist; no real 7-day external run | Keep deployment-gated and do not claim full spec |

## Active Feature Iteration

### Iteration 93: Invalid-Output Delayed Reward Voiding

Feature capability: make late assigned `Invalid` attestations contest already settled receipts by voiding
their delayed pending receipt rewards before any spendable credit.

Canonical owner: `chain::validation::submit_attestation` mutates `settled_receipts`,
`challenged_receipts`, and `pending_receipt_rewards`.
Adapter callers: command, RPC, p2p, runtime, and checker paths continue to submit attestations through the
same chain API.
Old shortcut being removed: late invalid-output evidence blocked future quorum but did not contest pending
rewards for a receipt that had already settled.
Regression test that proves the shortcut is gone:
`chain::tests::invalid_output_evidence_voids_delayed_receipt_rewards_before_release`.
Behavior with local synthetic block production disabled: attestation admission mutates canonical chain state
directly; no synthetic producer loop is required.
Behavior for producer and non-producer roles: both roles apply the same attestation event through chain
validation and converge on the same settled set and pending reward flags.
Structured evidence source: `settled_receipts`, `challenged_receipts`, and `pending_receipt_rewards`.
Finality source: canonical chain state height and delayed reward claim maturity.
Wire-size and codec boundary: no p2p, block, storage, request, or consensus codec change.

Files/modules likely touched: `chain/validation.rs`, focused settlement tests, docs, and this plan.
Parallel subagents to run: none; user prefers no subagents unless explicitly requested.
Tests/checkers/docs to add or update: focused settlement test and economics docs.
Narrow validation commands: `cargo test -p tensor_vm invalid_output_evidence --quiet` and
`cargo test -p tensor_vm settlement --quiet`.
Broad validation commands before commit: final Gate 0, fmt, diff check, full tensor_vm crate, clippy,
workspace release, tarpaulin attempt if feasible.
Expected observable evidence: a late invalid-output attestation removes the receipt from settled state,
marks it challenged, voids miner and validator pending receipt rewards, and mature release credits nothing.
Out of scope: miner stake slashing for invalid output, external drand/VRF, Docker rerun, or codec changes.
Split trigger: if invalid-output stake slash records are added, split that from delayed reward voiding.

Implementation summary:
- Late assigned `Invalid` attestations now mark the receipt challenged, remove it from settled receipts,
  and void matching pending miner and validator receipt rewards.
- Added a settlement regression proving mature release credits nothing after invalid-output evidence voids
  delayed receipt rewards.
- Updated economics/readiness docs and coverage notes.

Validation evidence:
- First Gate 0: `cargo test -p tensor_vm local_testnet --release` passed before edits.
- Focused: `cargo test -p tensor_vm invalid_output_evidence --quiet` and
  `cargo test -p tensor_vm settlement --quiet` passed.
- Formatting/whitespace: `cargo fmt --check --all` and `git diff --check` passed.
- TensorVM crate: `cargo test -p tensor_vm --quiet` passed 423 library tests plus integration tests.
- Lints: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed.
- Release workspace: `cargo test --workspace --release` passed.
- Final Gate 0: `cargo test -p tensor_vm local_testnet --release` passed.
- Coverage attempt: `cargo tarpaulin --workspace --offline` remains blocked by `error: no such command:
  tarpaulin`.

## Recent Iterations

### Iteration 91: Explicit Fraud-Window Reward Delay Evidence

`ChainParams::fraud_reward_hold_blocks` now makes receipt reward maturity explicitly cover the challenge
window plus active audit window before spendability. Reward economics regression coverage uses delayed
pending miner rewards rather than a mature-claim workaround. Validation passed focused reward/params,
full crate, clippy, workspace release, and first/final Gate 0. Commit `31bcc49` is pushed to `origin/main`.

### Iteration 92: Live Detection Probability Evidence

`ChainState::detection_probability_evidence`, service status, and explorer overview now expose live
per-mechanism probability evidence for implemented verifier/fraud paths. Validation passed focused
detection/status/explorer tests, full crate, clippy, workspace release, and first/final Gate 0. Commit
`5697593` is pushed to `origin/main`.

### Iteration 90: Chain-Owned Randomness Binding Evidence

Status/explorer now expose finalized-beacon randomness source, seed domains, anchor consistency counts,
commit-reveal ordering, and the current-block-hash randomness ban. Validation passed focused randomness,
status, explorer, full crate, clippy, workspace release, and first/final Gate 0. Commit `c6baaf5` is
pushed to `origin/main`.

### Iteration 89: Delayed Receipt Reward Fraud Exposure

Validator-audit and data-unavailability calibration now count `reward_from_fraud` only from non-voided
receipt claims whose `claimable_at_height` is at or below canonical chain height. Immature pending miner
and validator receipt rewards remain at-risk escrow but no longer inflate immediate fraud proceeds.
Validation passed focused reward/status/explorer tests, full crate, clippy, workspace release, and
first/final Gate 0. Commit `ece08ff` is pushed to `origin/main`.

### Iteration 88: Competing-Head Fork-Choice And Withholding Policy

Current-head useful UVPoW competitors can replace only an unfinalized same-parent useful head when the new
PoW evidence is strictly preferred; finalized heads, historical heights, different-parent conflicts, and
fallback heads remain stable. Validation passed focused block/payload tests, full crate, clippy, workspace
release, and first/final Gate 0. Commits `3a75b33`, `d2e758d`, and `1484592` are pushed to `origin/main`.

### Iteration 87: Delayed Block-Check Proposer Reward Protection

`ChainParams::proposer_reward_hold_blocks` delays proposer rewards through the block-check fraud window.
Block-check economics now treats delayed proposer rewards as slashable escrow and only mature claims as
fraud proceeds. Validation passed focused reward/storage/status/explorer/params/challenge tests, full
crate, clippy, workspace release, and first/final Gate 0. Commits `1923692`, `b638369`, and `d4d11b8` are
pushed to `origin/main`.

### Iteration 86: Fraud-Path Economic Calibration

Implementation summary:
- Added `ChainState::fraud_path_economic_calibration` for validator-audit, miner data-unavailability, and
  block-check/proposer clawback paths.
- Service status and explorer overview now render aggregate and per-path required-bond/pass-fail evidence.
- Updated `upow.md`, readiness, coverage, implementation status, and tarpaulin docs.

Validation evidence:
- First Gate 0: `cargo test -p tensor_vm local_testnet --release` passed before edits.
- Focused: `cargo test -p tensor_vm economic --quiet`, `cargo test -p tensor_vm status --quiet`, and
  `cargo test -p tensor_vm explorer_overview_exports --quiet` passed.
- Formatting/whitespace: `cargo fmt --check --all` and `git diff --check` passed.
- TensorVM crate: `cargo test -p tensor_vm --quiet` passed 415 library tests plus integration tests.
- Lints: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed.
- Release workspace: `cargo test --workspace --release` passed.
- Final Gate 0: `cargo test -p tensor_vm local_testnet --release` passed.
- Coverage attempt: `cargo tarpaulin --workspace --offline` remains blocked by `error: no such command:
  tarpaulin`.
- Feature commit: `1116beb` (`Expose fraud path economic calibration`) pushed to `origin/main`.
- Evidence commit: `abf78d1` (`Record fraud path calibration evidence`) pushed to `origin/main`.

### Iteration 85: Audit-Window Reward Escrow

`ChainParams::reward_maturity_delay_blocks` now includes the validator-audit hold when audit sampling is
enabled, and tensor retention mirrors the same audit-window bound. No-audit profiles keep the old
zero-retention behavior. Validation passed focused parameter/audit/reward tests, full crate, clippy,
workspace release, and first/final Gate 0. Commit `5df4870` (`Delay rewards through audit window`) is
pushed to `origin/main`.

### Iteration 84: Validator Audit Stake-Slash Reversal

Reversed validator-audit appeals now refund the recorded stake slash from treasury back to validator stake
exactly once while reward reinstatement still uses delayed pending claims. Validation passed focused
audit/storage/reward tests, full crate, clippy, workspace release, and first/final Gate 0. Commits
`1feeb1d` and `ea230b3` are pushed to `origin/main`.

## Decision Log

- `upow.md` is canonical; `mvp_spec.md` wins where `upow.md` is silent.
- Gate 0 command `cargo test -p tensor_vm local_testnet --release` must be the first executable
  acceptance command of every new/resumed implementation iteration.
- TensorWork is never proposer selection input; block proposal is validator-owned useful-verification PoW.
- Consensus mutation belongs in shared chain/IR/verifier layers, not `tvmd`, p2p/RPC adapters,
  deployment scripts, or checker-only branches.
- Multi-agent writer work is not used unless explicitly requested and file ownership is non-overlapping.
