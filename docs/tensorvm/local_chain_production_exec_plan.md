# Local Chain Production Execution Plan

This file is the durable source of truth for local-chain production-readiness work. Keep it compact:
current status, active/recent iterations, validation evidence, blockers, and archive commit anchors only.

## Current State

- Active feature: Iteration 91 complete - explicit fraud-window reward delay evidence.
- Current status: delayed proposer, receipt, challenge, validator-audit, and credit rewards are
  state-rooted pending claims. Validator-owned proposal, block votes, audit-report gossip, observed
  malformed block-check challenge handling, parent-state snapshots, and delayed challenge rewards are
  implemented locally. Iteration 85 added audit-window-aware reward escrow and tensor retention.
- Current blockers:
  - `docs/tensorvm/codex_5_5_local_chain_workflow.md` is referenced by `goal.md` but is missing.
  - `cargo tarpaulin --workspace --offline` is blocked because `cargo-tarpaulin` is not installed:
    `error: no such command: tarpaulin`.
  - Full Docker runtime verification remains unresolved from the prior recorded run: gateway `/health`
    timed out with `curl: (28) Operation timed out after 15002 milliseconds with 0 bytes received`.
- Next action: continue full multi-branch fork-tree work, measured economics, or rerun the full Docker
  scenario after the `/health` blocker clears.

## Readiness Matrix

| Capability | Status | Evidence | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gate 0 local CPU testnet | Passing | First command this iteration: `cargo test -p tensor_vm local_testnet --release` passed on June 20, 2026 | Keep as first executable gate on every resume |
| Shared chain engine/profile-neutral API | Complete for current core | Shared `ChainEngine`, `ChainCommand`, profile tests, local-testnet Gate 0 | Preserve one transition engine while adding IR/runtime features |
| Role-owned miner receipts | Implemented locally | Miner role submits receipts through `ChainCommand::SubmitReceipt`; checker expects live counters | Rerun full Docker checker after `/health` blocker clears |
| Role-owned validator attestations | Implemented locally | Validator role verifies assigned receipts, fetches tensors remotely, submits attestations | Keep as input path for IR-backed jobs |
| Role-owned validator block votes | Implemented locally | Validator role submits/gossips `SubmitBlockVote`; non-producers ingest/apply votes | Preserve append/finality separation |
| Role-owned validator proposer tick | Implemented in Rust runtime; Docker proof pending | `validator_proposer_tick_runs_without_synthetic_producer_gate`; useful proposal counters; delayed proposer rewards; current-head useful competitor replacement | Rerun Docker and continue full fork-tree policy |
| Network-visible event ingestion | Implemented locally | Node runtime ingests decoded jobs, receipts, attestations, block payloads, votes, audits, and block-check challenges | Extend only through shared codecs/events |
| Canonical useful-verification block validity | Partial | UVPoW target/nonce, selected roots, checks roots, beacon binding, fallback eligibility/timeout, parent snapshots, delayed rewards, diagnostic block-check challenges, current-head competitor policy | Remaining: full transcript disputes, full multi-branch fork trees, fresh Docker proof |
| Tensor IR graph language | Partial | `TensorGraph`, canonical JSON, `graph_id`, registry validation, program storage/serving, graph jobs/receipts, exact replay for current core and broad Tier-B surface | Continue exact Tier-B verifier coverage and role-runtime arbitrary graph production |
| Per-op `F_p` conformance vectors | Partial | Registry guard, CPU profile evidence, vectors for current admitted ops; default CUDA non-admission | Add CUDA conformance evidence and remaining exact Tier-B vectors |
| Randomness commit/reveal or VRF beacon | Partial | Receipts persist receipt-time finalized beacon randomness, assignment seed, validation seed commitment; attestations require anchor; status/explorer expose seed-domain and block-hash-ban evidence | Add external drand/VRF construction and deployed commit-reveal lifecycle |
| Economics and slashing invariant | Partial | Delayed rewards, reward-root binding, mature release, audit/data-unavailability slashing, appeal reversal, pending claim view, study helper, validator-audit and fraud-path calibration | Add measured detection probabilities, remaining fraud paths, and broader invalid-output slashing |
| Public deployment evidence | Not complete | Public evidence validators/templates exist; no real 7-day external run | Keep deployment-gated and do not claim full spec |

## Active Feature Iteration

### Iteration 91: Explicit Fraud-Window Reward Delay Evidence

Feature capability: make reward maturity expose the consensus fraud-window hold directly, so economics
does not depend on a mature-claim workaround when reasoning about data-unavailability or audit exposure.

Canonical owner: `ChainParams` owns reward maturity windows; `ChainState` only evaluates pending claims
against canonical height and claimability.
Adapter callers: status/explorer continue to read chain-owned pending claims and economic calibration.
Old shortcut being removed: tests can inject already-mature fraud rewards and rely on calibration filtering
to make immature rewards harmless, instead of proving normal settled rewards stay delayed for the fraud
window.
Regression test that proves the shortcut is gone: focused params/reward tests prove receipt reward
claimability includes the explicit fraud hold and that normal pending rewards have zero spendable fraud
proceeds before the hold expires.
Behavior with local synthetic block production disabled: delay is derived from chain params and block
height, independent of synthetic block production.
Behavior for producer and non-producer roles: producers enqueue delayed claims during settlement; peers
replay the same claimable heights from chain transition.
Structured evidence source: `ChainParams::reward_maturity_delay_blocks`, pending reward ledgers,
`ChainState::fraud_path_economic_calibration`, service status, and explorer overview JSON.
Finality source: canonical block height and configured challenge/audit windows; adapter clocks and checker
counters do not affect spendability.
Wire-size and codec boundary: no p2p, block, storage, or request codec change; additive params/test/doc
evidence only unless status fields prove necessary.

Files/modules likely touched: `chain/state.rs`, chain reward/params tests, docs, and this plan.
Parallel subagents to run: none; user prefers no subagents unless explicitly requested.
Tests/checkers/docs to add or update: focused params/reward tests and concise economics docs.
Narrow validation commands: `cargo test -p tensor_vm reward --quiet` and
`cargo test -p tensor_vm params --quiet`.
Broad validation commands before commit: final Gate 0, fmt, diff check, full tensor_vm crate, clippy,
workspace release, tarpaulin attempt if feasible.
Expected observable evidence: normally settled rewards remain pending until the canonical fraud-window hold
has passed, while economic calibration reports zero spendable fraud proceeds before claimability.
Out of scope: new fraud paths, measured detection probability studies, Docker rerun, or codec changes.
Split trigger: if delaying rewards requires block/storage schema changes or broad settlement rewrites,
split that from this params/evidence slice.

Implementation summary:
- Added `ChainParams::fraud_reward_hold_blocks` and made receipt reward maturity explicitly cover the
  challenge window plus the active validator-audit window before spendability.
- Updated reward economics regression coverage so data-unavailability exposure uses delayed pending miner
  rewards rather than a mature-claim workaround.
- Updated `upow.md`, implementation status, coverage matrix, tarpaulin notes, and this plan.

Validation evidence:
- First Gate 0: `cargo test -p tensor_vm local_testnet --release` passed before edits.
- Focused: `cargo test -p tensor_vm reward --quiet` and `cargo test -p tensor_vm params --quiet` passed.
- Formatting/whitespace: `cargo fmt --check --all` and `git diff --check` passed.
- TensorVM crate: `cargo test -p tensor_vm --quiet` passed 421 library tests plus integration tests.
- Lints: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed.
- Release workspace: `cargo test --workspace --release` passed.
- Final Gate 0: `cargo test -p tensor_vm local_testnet --release` passed.
- Coverage attempt: `cargo tarpaulin --workspace --offline` remains blocked by `error: no such command:
  tarpaulin`.

## Recent Iterations

### Iteration 90: Chain-Owned Randomness Binding Evidence

Status/explorer now expose finalized-beacon randomness source, seed domains, anchor consistency counts,
commit-reveal ordering, and the current-block-hash randomness ban. Validation passed focused randomness,
status, explorer, full crate, clippy, workspace release, and first/final Gate 0. Commit `c6baaf5` is
pushed to `origin/main`.

### Iteration 89: Delayed Receipt Reward Fraud Exposure

Validator-audit and data-unavailability calibration now count `reward_from_fraud` only from non-voided
receipt claims whose `claimable_at_height` is at or below canonical chain height. Immature pending miner
and validator receipt rewards remain at-risk escrow but no longer inflate immediate fraud proceeds.
Validation passed focused reward/status/explorer tests, full crate, clippy, workspace release, and
first/final Gate 0. Commit `ece08ff` is pushed to `origin/main`.

### Iteration 88: Competing-Head Fork-Choice And Withholding Policy

Current-head useful UVPoW competitors can replace only an unfinalized same-parent useful head when the new
PoW evidence is strictly preferred; finalized heads, historical heights, different-parent conflicts, and
fallback heads remain stable. Validation passed focused block/payload tests, full crate, clippy, workspace
release, and first/final Gate 0. Commits `3a75b33`, `d2e758d`, and `1484592` are pushed to `origin/main`.

### Iteration 87: Delayed Block-Check Proposer Reward Protection

`ChainParams::proposer_reward_hold_blocks` delays proposer rewards through the block-check fraud window.
Block-check economics now treats delayed proposer rewards as slashable escrow and only mature claims as
fraud proceeds. Validation passed focused reward/storage/status/explorer/params/challenge tests, full
crate, clippy, workspace release, and first/final Gate 0. Commits `1923692`, `b638369`, and `d4d11b8` are
pushed to `origin/main`.

### Iteration 86: Fraud-Path Economic Calibration

Implementation summary:
- Added `ChainState::fraud_path_economic_calibration` for validator-audit, miner data-unavailability, and
  block-check/proposer clawback paths.
- Service status and explorer overview now render aggregate and per-path required-bond/pass-fail evidence.
- Updated `upow.md`, readiness, coverage, implementation status, and tarpaulin docs.

Validation evidence:
- First Gate 0: `cargo test -p tensor_vm local_testnet --release` passed before edits.
- Focused: `cargo test -p tensor_vm economic --quiet`, `cargo test -p tensor_vm status --quiet`, and
  `cargo test -p tensor_vm explorer_overview_exports --quiet` passed.
- Formatting/whitespace: `cargo fmt --check --all` and `git diff --check` passed.
- TensorVM crate: `cargo test -p tensor_vm --quiet` passed 415 library tests plus integration tests.
- Lints: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed.
- Release workspace: `cargo test --workspace --release` passed.
- Final Gate 0: `cargo test -p tensor_vm local_testnet --release` passed.
- Coverage attempt: `cargo tarpaulin --workspace --offline` remains blocked by `error: no such command:
  tarpaulin`.
- Feature commit: `1116beb` (`Expose fraud path economic calibration`) pushed to `origin/main`.
- Evidence commit: `abf78d1` (`Record fraud path calibration evidence`) pushed to `origin/main`.

### Iteration 85: Audit-Window Reward Escrow

`ChainParams::reward_maturity_delay_blocks` now includes the validator-audit hold when audit sampling is
enabled, and tensor retention mirrors the same audit-window bound. No-audit profiles keep the old
zero-retention behavior. Validation passed focused parameter/audit/reward tests, full crate, clippy,
workspace release, and first/final Gate 0. Commit `5df4870` (`Delay rewards through audit window`) is
pushed to `origin/main`.

### Iteration 84: Validator Audit Stake-Slash Reversal

Reversed validator-audit appeals now refund the recorded stake slash from treasury back to validator stake
exactly once while reward reinstatement still uses delayed pending claims. Validation passed focused
audit/storage/reward tests, full crate, clippy, workspace release, and first/final Gate 0. Commits
`1feeb1d` and `ea230b3` are pushed to `origin/main`.

## Decision Log

- `upow.md` is canonical; `mvp_spec.md` wins where `upow.md` is silent.
- Gate 0 command `cargo test -p tensor_vm local_testnet --release` must be the first executable
  acceptance command of every new/resumed implementation iteration.
- TensorWork is never proposer selection input; block proposal is validator-owned useful-verification PoW.
- Consensus mutation belongs in shared chain/IR/verifier layers, not `tvmd`, p2p/RPC adapters,
  deployment scripts, or checker-only branches.
- Multi-agent writer work is not used unless explicitly requested and file ownership is non-overlapping.
